Many businesses offer their products with a “list price”, and then apply various discounts to certain types of customer. A large pizza chain is rarely able to charge full price for a pizza, for example. And very few customers are willing to pay the full price.
This means that the web sites of such businesses have to carry out calculations that takes what the customer has ordered to arrive at a final price.

The Task

A certain pizza takeaway offers any of its pizzas for a fixed price. The price can be changed every day. All pizzas cost the same, regardless of recipe. For every pizza ordered, a customer may order another for half price. In addition, if the total order is over £50 (after the "half price" discount), a whopping 35% discount is applied to the total.
To be clear, the “half price” offer only applies where a full price pizza has been ordered. So an order of four pizzas would be charged at two full price, two half price. A order for five pizzas would be three full price, and two half price.
your task is to write a program that takes the current price of a single pizza, finds how many the customer has ordered, and applies any relevant discounts.
